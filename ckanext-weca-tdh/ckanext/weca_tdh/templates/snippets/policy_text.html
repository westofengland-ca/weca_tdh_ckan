    <p>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the
        internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer
        or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.
    </p>
    <p>These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>enabling a service to recognise your device, so you don't have to give the same information several times
            during one task
        </li>
        <li>recognising that you may already have given a username and password, so you don't need to do it for every
            web page requested
        </li>
        <li>measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity
            to ensure they are fast
        </li>
        <li>recognising which people are visiting our web pages through social media sites, to make it possible to use
            targeted advertising
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can manage these small files yourself. You can learn more about them on <a
